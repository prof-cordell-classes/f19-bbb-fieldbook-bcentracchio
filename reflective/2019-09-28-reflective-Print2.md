_Reflective Entry 2_

Content from this week introduced me to many details I see, but not necessarily notice, in everyday life. Print and font appear in the 
5,000 ads I see daily, in the textbooks I pore over between classes, and across the screens I spend so much time focused on. To have my
eyes opened to some of the finer decisions made by graphic designers helps me better understand the text I read as a whole. 

  "Readers usually  ignore the typographic interference, gliding comfortable along literacy's habitual groove." (p. 99)

A book can be described as the sum of its parts (physical pages, covers, bindings, print, typeface etc.), but it cannot be completely 
defined by these contributing factors. Arguably more important to a book is the psychological content. At the end of the day, for most 
authors the physical form of the book is irrelevant to the implications of the type contained within. And while those tangible factors are still important 
(enough to have an entire class about), we should think about typeface and font as simply the artistic interface between text and 
understanding.

"Some designers viewed teh distortion of the alphabet as gross and immoral, tied to a destructive and inhumane industrial system." (p. 27)

MY favorite theme from our classroom discussion was brought up by a student mentioning the stigma around "illegible" typeface. While first browsing 
available fonts on Microsoft Word, most people no doubt encountered uncomfortably-designed types like Old English or Gothic. A question that jumps
to mind is "Why?". They often feel more difficult to decipher than it's worth, so why bother inventing new styles that can't easily be read?
But the student drew an intriguing parallel to music. If classical composers listened to modern music, it would sound like displeasing noise.
Art is created when boundaries are pushed and we become experimental. That noise is the same as illegibility, there is niche use and reader needed
for the work to be fully understood. It seems ignorant to write off (pun intended) a typeface for being too artistically complex, when in reality
we probably just don't know how to utilize it. 

That said, is there anything more obnoxious than someone creating noise, just to create noise? Tasteful is the key word here. Poorly designed font
serves minimal purpose, and there must be a threshold of quality to be of value in its function. The artist must be aware of the commonly 
accepted rules before they are broken. Noise can be intelligently and intentionally used to create discomfort. Often this is where the technological, 
artistic, and even social breakthroughs come from. Dealing with what is typically perceived as annoyance in a progressive and respectful manner.
