_Reflective Entry #1_

    After reading *The Book* by Amaranth Borsuk and our classroom activities handling artifacts, I have come to view and define books 
in a much broader sense. _The Book_ took me through the history of written word, from hieroglyphics, to the printing press, all the way 
to modern e-books. While I had previously studied some aspects of this evolution in high school English and Social Studies classes, I 
enjoyed thinking about the development from a scientific standpoint. As a bioengineering major, there is seemingly little overlap between 
my STEM course material and the art of bookmaking. Books are clearly not implantable medical devices, and serve more as the vehicle for 
my learning than anything. However, digging deeper into the innovation behind the unique aspects of the codex and its relatives, I 
discovered a wealth of potential for new ideas. 
    The most intriguing sections of _The Book_ (for me) depicted unique inventions by artists, stretching the definition of a "Book". 
Whether it was Alison Knowles' _The Big Book_, or Mallarme's _A Roll of the Dice_, I was inspired to think about how I might invent a 
book in a new light. I'll get the chance to experiment in our upcoming book project, I'm excited to see how creative I can be. 
    During our classtimes we were treated to handling codices that are centuries old. First I observed a geography guide from the early 1800s and later in the archives I worked with a History of London from the mid 18th century. I noticed some contrasting styles in the header, annotations, watermarks, and font. However even more striking to me was the similarities between the texts. I found both documents fairly easy to read, despite being 200+ years old and from different countries. Through all the books' usage the physical codex has begun to wither. And yet, the english language prevails. 
    To ponder the evolution of written text is a neverending story. Reflecting on its future provides opportunity for inspiration. 
I'm left with three questions that connect my career path to the book. 
Can I use the genius of the codex, optimized for the human body, to deliver drugs to patients in a new way? 
Must a commonly-accepted treatment be so narrowly defined? 
How far can we realistically push innovation to keep up with the future while drawing on our successes of the past, and more importantly, 
can we create something that will last just as long as the book?
