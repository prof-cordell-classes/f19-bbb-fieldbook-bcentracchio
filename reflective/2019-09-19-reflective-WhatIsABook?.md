_Reflective Entry #1_

After reading *The Book* by Amaranth Borsuk and our classroom activities handling artifacts, I have come to view and define books 
in a much broader sense. _The Book_ took me through the history of written word, from hieroglyphics, to the printing press, all the way 
to modern e-books. While I had previously studied some aspects of this evolution in high school English and Social Studies classes, I 
enjoyed thinking about the development from a scientific standpoint. As a bioengineering major, there is seemingly little overlap between 
my STEM course material and the art of bookmaking. Books are clearly not implantable medical devices, and serve more as the vehicle for 
my learning than anything. However, digging deeper into the innovation behind the unique aspects of the codex and its relatives, I 
discovered a wealth of potential for new ideas. 

The most intriguing sections of _The Book_ (for me) depicted unique inventions by artists, stretching the definition of a "Book". 
Whether it was Alison Knowles' _The Big Book_, or Mallarme's _A Roll of the Dice_, I was inspired to think about how I might invent a 
book in a new light. Borsuk writes this about Mallarme's work: 
 
    "By the end of the text, we are holding the open book as a buoy or flotation device we hope will take us, as the penultimate line suggests, to "some final place of consecration."" (p. 132)
    
She describes the interaction with the ending of the book as an oceanic experience, so deep and swirling we have to grip the physical book
to anchor us. I'll get the chance to experiment with interactive writing in our upcoming book project, I'm excited to see how creative I
can be, and if I can create the same sort of riptide participation. If I can engage with my work and draw knowledge I've accumulated from
my STEM classes I think the final product can be extremely original and satisfying to both the reader and myself.

During our classtimes we were treated to handling codices that are centuries old. First I observed a geography guide from the early 1800s
and later in the archives I worked with a guide to London from the mid 18th century. I noticed some contrasting styles in the header,
annotations, watermarks, and font. Each had unique influences, and very likely went on to influence future non-fiction bookmakers. However
even more striking to me was the similarities between the texts. I found both documents fairly easy to read, despite being 200+ years old
and from different countries. Through all the books' usage the physical codex has begun to wither. And yet, the english language prevails. 
    
    "The process of the book's adaptation to its readers is not yet over, though the  printed codex has had a stable life for over five hundred years" (Borsuk, p.258)

To ponder the evolution of written text is a neverending story. Reflecting on its future provides opportunity for inspiration. 
I'm left with three questions that connect my career path to the book. 

Can I use the genius of the codex, optimized for the human body, to deliver drugs or other life-saving technologies to patients in a new way? 

Must a commonly-accepted treatment be so narrowly defined? 

How far can we realistically push innovation to keep up with the future while drawing on our successes of the past, and more importantly, can we create something that will last just as long as the book?
