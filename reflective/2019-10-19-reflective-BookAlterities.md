_Reflective Entry - Book Alterities_

This unit, perhaps more than any other we have reached so far, pushes the boundaries of what a book can be. The author's interpretations 
vary widely throughout the examples in our readings and in-class artifacts. One common theme I'd like to dig into is the accessibility of 
these products, or the lack thereof. 

A New York Times article was written about Katie Paterson, a Scottish artist who is collecting "100 unpublished works that won’t be 
released in their writers’ lifetimes". 1000 spruce trees are being grown until 2114 when they will be used for the paper of 100 books by 
celebrated writers. While this initially feels extremely original and intriguing, there is also the realization that neither the authors 
nor Paterson will reap the delayed gratification. The project began surrounded by hype and excitement, but as each year passes the novelty 
fades and the potential readers age. There arises the question of whether the project will ever come to fruition? Natural disasters, human
temptations, and carelessness could all ruin the forested library. But that is part of the intent. What began as a literary experiment has
the potential for a fascinating human analysis. Testing the balance of patience/resolve vs. how much we value artist books. Can we consider 
the trees themselves books? They are growing with the intent of being books, but personally I don't think they are books until they're 
fused with content. Inaccessible "books" fall under a unique category in my personal working definition. They give off a much more 
frustrating feeling, but as long as content and structure are there, I'm willing to see them as a valuable book.

Another inaccessible artist book we studied was _Boundless_, in the NU Archives. It was a disc of paper connected by spiral notebook binding.
