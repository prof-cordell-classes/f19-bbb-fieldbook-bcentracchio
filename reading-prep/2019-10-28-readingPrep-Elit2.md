_Reaqading Prep - E Lit 2_

1. *Question*: In response to _With Those We Love Alive_. With physical books we are able to focus predominantly on the content and the 
associated emotions because we are accustomed to the structure and interface. On the other hand, with e-lit I feel more need to judge and 
focus on the architecture of the book much more. Does e-literature diminish the potential for emotional transmission?

2. *Question*: In response to _Third Generation Electronic Literature_. Flores writes about the development of artificial intelligence and
some of the role it plays in e-lit. Is an online conversation with a bot a book? What if the bot is programmed to lead the user down a 
narrative? What if it was truly  intelligent, and was a natural conversation? The transcription could be framed as a book, but can you 
consider the AI itself e-lit?

3. *Observation*: Notes on *Hobo Lobo of Hamelin* from Electronic Literature Collection Volume 3.

-The piece is an electronic pop-up book, with illustrations that accompany a fantastical story with sinister political and moral undertones

-Immediately the narrator has a very unique, unabashed voice: "Once upon a time, in an age long forgotten because it was somewhat boring
and contrived..."

-It feels like the book could have been an interpretation of a real picture book. Aside from a few small animations and music, the 
electronic format is unnessential to the story. It could easily be converted to paper. That characteristic influences my comprehension of
the piece, because it feels more familiar than a more extreme projecct like *What Football Will Look Like in the Future*.
