*_The Book_ Questions and Observations*

1. Observation: I quite enjoyed Borsuk's writing style. She takes a subject that could be written about extremely dryly, 
and handles it in a very engaging, informative way. She picks unique and compelling examples throughout each chapter 
that constantly reengage my mind. For example, Alison Knowles' _The Big Book_ was a project I had never heard of. 
The originality of the interpretation, and Borsuk's integration of the image (page 153) and quotes made this section
an enjoyable read for me. 

2. Question: It's interesting to think about the rate of technological development over the course of history. 
We seemingly have hit an unprecedented growth spurt over the past century. Borsuk writes in Chapter 1 about how 
the development of writing was a massive breakthrough. Recording and distributing knowledge created massive opportunity
for innovation and advancement. By looking at the book as a technology in and of itself that has allowed the creation
of countless other technologies, is there a more important invention in human history than the book?

3. Question: A common theme in _The Book_ is how the codex's form fits its purpose. Structurally, it perfectly fits 
in a human reader's hands, portably carries huge amounts of information, and can withstand the erosion from thousands of readers.
The codex is a tried and true invention with many affordances and almost no limitations. That is, until e-books etc. came along.
Online reading pointed out flaws in the codex the everyday reader would barely notice. Can we ever go back to viewing 
the traditional book as perfect, or is the proverbial glass broken?
