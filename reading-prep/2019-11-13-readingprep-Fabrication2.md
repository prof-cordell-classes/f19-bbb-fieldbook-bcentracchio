1. Question: "Critical making examines objects that are never fixed" (Resch)
Objects that are never fixed are either constantly evolving or physically moving. Is "critical making" through 3-D printing the best method we currently have to examine evolving objeccts?

2. Question: Hichar's book project using Arduino reminds me of when I learned to use Arduino in a first year engineering class. We had to first learn the language, then come  up with a creative way to apply it. That process has many other applications when incorporating something new. First the creator must learn about the new skill/tech, then come up with a creative way to implement it. Is that a holistic process, or are there more steps that you might use to invent? I'm curious as to how other people's thought process works.

3. Question: In a world of evolving technology, how do we stay grounded in what we know and trust (ex. the codex) rather than getting swept away in the temptation of the new and shiny?
