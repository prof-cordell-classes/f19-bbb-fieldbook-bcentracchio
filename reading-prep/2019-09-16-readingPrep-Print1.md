_Reading Prep_

1. Question: One recurring theme I noticed from the readings was how letterpress has come back into style. "It's so old, it's new" wrote David Jury. 
Like fanny packs, Polaroid cameras, and countless other products, the letterpress has seemingly come back from the dead to satiate
our need for stylistic uniqueness. Letterpressed business cards, Christmas cards, and even books are a sophisticated trend.
My question is what other literary trends might make a "comeback"? Will we learn about other bookmaking techniques we will soon see 
in the modern day book?

2. Question: Another theme that dug into my mind was the underappreciation of the En Space. I had never heard of this little block, 
despite its incredible significance. It lead me to wonder what other everyday desk items we take for granted when reading a masterpiece. 
Whether it's J.K. Rowling's sticky notes or Mark Twain's pen, does imagining the author physically writing a book help you engage with 
the text?

3. Observation: The Stephen Fry film helped me appreciate the long history of the letterpress. Gutenburg's innovation revolutionized litersry technology. 
I also appreciated the incorporation of film into the reading assignment. Watching Stephen literally create paper and print letters filled in
many gaps in how I imagined the entire process to be done. Gutenburg probably spent a year creating 200+ letter blocks. This shows his
dedication to this masterpiece of his life's work. I had a hard time imagining pouring that much of myself into a singular product, 
but as I study medical devices that's likely going to be a big part of my career. Gutenburg inspired me to be more passionate about my work,
and hopefully I can leave a legacy as  long as his.
