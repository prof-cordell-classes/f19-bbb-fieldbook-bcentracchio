_Reading Prep - Book Alterities_

1. Question - Carrion writes that books are "sequences of spaces" and "moments". But spaces are defined by what surrounds them. Why focus 
on the space and their place in time rather than words and the content within, rather than the lack of content? 

2. Question - When reading up on the Xenotext I found myself remembering that we learned the words "transcription" and "translation" when
talking about how DNA data is transformed into proteins. This seems like a logical progression to interpret a genome as a text, and try 
to create a project using that medium. But how far do we need to stretch our definition of a book? Does it count if the xenotype is 
partially succesfull (not the entire poem is expressed by bacteria, or maybeit doesn't last as long as intended)? What about if another
product forms, completely outside the realm of the author's intention? Are those still texts/books?

3. Observation - When talking about book alterities there's a unique dynamic that balances science and the arts. Scientists like Bok can
create new books using intricate scientific knowledge, while altered books like *A Humument* are very artistic with a different kind of 
intricacy. There is so much potential under both realms and books are a great example of the overlap between them.
