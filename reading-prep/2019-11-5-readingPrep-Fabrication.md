_Reading Prep - Fabrication_

1. *Question*: The first piece talks about the idea of the "adjacent possible", giving the evolution of a Lego brick as an example. What 
is an example of an adjacent possible for the codex? Does a Kindle fit that description? What about a magazine? Finding the appropriate
amount of similarity and difference allows us to advance our technologies step by step, so we have something familiar to fall back on.

2. *Observation*: During my mechanical engineering co-op I worked a lot with 3-D printing, computer design, CNC machines, Arduino and 
other technologies mentioned in the chapter. I felt very comfortable reading about all the technical modes of manufacturing, and I can 
easily see the parallels between fields of study. The 3-D printed book project feels like a very appropriate celebration for Einstein
and all his contributions towards science. Futuristically printing a codex reflects the importance of merging literature with technology.

3. *Question*: In the Lincoln mask article Garfinkel writes: "Copies — 3-D prints or otherwise — bring meaning back to the original 
just as the original grounds and situates its abundant copies". Does this still hold up if there were multiple originals? At what threshold
does value relationship change between number of copies and number of originals?
