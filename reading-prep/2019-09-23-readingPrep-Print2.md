_Reading Prep Print 2_

1. From the Lupton chapters, I engaged with all the little details about typeface I had never thought about before. Becoming aware of the
history and intricacies of print and type has been my favorite part of this class. Learning about the structure of characters or the framework
of a book illuminates things  I take for granted. Having never realized how much thought goes into each of these literary machines, I was
missing out on some fascinating subjects. Learning about the little parts is essential to fully understanding the whole masterpiece. In 
this case, that masterpiece is written language. What other aspects of written language do I know nothing about? I don't know what I don't 
know. 

2. I really enjoyed reading the interview with Pablo Medina, who designs typeface. My favorite line was: "Bushwick the Typeface has 
a "clave": or a dance to it that separates it from the masses". It got me thinking about how we interact with typeface, and the feelings 
they evoke. Why does one tpyeface seem more sophisticated than another? Why do some feel more fun and dancy, while others feel drab?
Is it because of the way the letters are designed, or simply by association with items they are  printed on?

3. I researched the Windsor font on Fontreviewjournal.com. Below are my notes on what I found most interesting.
- Of British origin, by Eleisha Pechey in 1905
- My Initial reaction was that it would be perfect for an album cover. I was reminded of my childhood best friend that would show me tons of
music from the 60's and 70's, and I'm sure Windsor was on some of those albums.
- Similar to the "mulleted 'A'", you notice the party more than the business. Windsor seems to take itself seriously, when in reality it
is not.
- There were plenty of examples in different ads. Windsor goes along with images well.
- Distinguished by flares on the ends of letters and pinched gaps in others
- Evolution from feaux-official, to wonky, to retro, to classical. Over the years artists adjusted line weights, giving different feels
for different uses.
- Has light, elongated, and bold versions, and was initially released with an italics version.
