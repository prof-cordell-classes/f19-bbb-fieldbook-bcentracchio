_Reading Prep 4_

1. (Question) Along with the overarching theme of the class, would a zine classify as a book? Is it a specific category of book? 
Or does it depend on the author's intentions for the zine? 

2. (Question) Giant name brand magazines are often read for their reputation and expertise in a certain area. Zines are more often
personal and not as factually reliable. So what is the allure to reading zines like *Pagan's Head*? Interest in a specific person's life
and work, or maybe they write about a niche topic? Motivations are different for everyone and these probably fuel the ongoing interest
in zines even while the internet is rapidly providing easy literature access. 

3. (Question) Zines can spread in many different ways. They will be more poppular in some areas than others. What cultural factors play  
a role in the popularity of zines? Age? Population density? Education? What trends would you expect for a local zine's reader population?
